Siamese Network for Image Similarity Using ResNet50
    This project implements a Siamese network architecture to measure image similarity. The model leverages ResNet50 for feature extraction and computes the similarity between pairs of       images based on the L1 distance. The network is trained using pairs of images to classify them as either similar or dissimilar.
    
Key Features:
  ResNet50 for feature extraction.
  Siamese network architecture for similarity measurement.
  Binary classification for determining whether images are similar or not.
  Customizable training data (can use different sets of image pairs).
  Model evaluation and training using TensorFlow/Keras.

Technologies Used:
  Python, TensorFlow, Keras
  OpenCV for image preprocessing
  NumPy for numerical computations
